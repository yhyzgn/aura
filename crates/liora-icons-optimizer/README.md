# Liora Icons Optimizer

Build-time optimizer for Liora icon bundles.

## What it provides

Add this crate as a build dependency in applications that use bundled `IconName` enums. It scans Rust/content sources, copies only the used SVG files into the app icon bundle, and produces a report for packaging diagnostics.

## Quick example

```rust
fn main() {
    liora_icons_optimizer::Optimizer::new()
        .scan_dir("src")
        .bundle_auto()
        .run();
}
```

## Recommended usage

- Prefer the top-level `liora` crate for ordinary applications.
- Depend on `liora-icons-optimizer` directly when you need fine-grained dependency control or are building another Liora crate.
- Keep application UI pure Rust + native GPUI; Liora crates do not require WebView, Tauri, HTML, CSS, or DOM runtime paths.

## GPUI dependency note

Liora is developed against the official `zed-industries/zed` GPUI source. When building an application, follow the repository README for the exact GPUI git revision and patching guidance. Do not use unofficial GPUI forks unless the application owner explicitly accepts that risk.
